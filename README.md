## About:
- This is the Fall 2020 CSCI470 Semester Project

## Project:
- Topic Area: Supervised Learning, Binary Classification, Support Vector Model (SVM)
- Project Name: Binary Action Classifier
- Problem Statement:  Identify human actions from static wireframe poses
- Proposed Solution: Using wireframe skeleton data for different poses, our minimum viable product is a machine learning algorithm that recognizes if a skeleton is in a pose or not in that pose. A stretch goal will be identifying one of multiple different poses.
- Data: We will be using the Northwestern-UCLA Multiview Action 3D Dataset. The dataset contains information from multiple people performing 10 different types of actions. For every person performing an action, the dataset contains a CSV file where every line contains 5 values: the frame, joint id (20 joints total), x-pos, y-pos, z-pos. We plan on cleaning the data by selecting the most relevant frame and using the x, y, and z-positions of each joint to calculate features that will predict the pose someone is striking.
